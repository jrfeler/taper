          <Paragraph>Over time, the body adapts to opioid medications so that if you reduce them rapidly, withdrawal symptoms are likely. However, if you reduce the dose of opioids gradually, the body can make new adaptations to the lower doses and withdrawal symptoms generally are extremely mild or absent.

          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Veteran #1: “If you’ve experienced withdrawal symptoms before, it’s understandable that you’d be worried about going through that again. But the good news is, if you go slow enough with the taper – like you are doing – withdrawal symptoms are extremely unlikely. I’ll be honest, I didn’t even notice the medication was being lowered. Interestingly, my pain wasn’t even worse. At the end of the whole process, I just overall felt better – less sluggish than when I was on the medications.”

          <Paragraph>Lots of people feel that it is the medication that is keeping you functioning so if you lower the medication, your functioning will get worse. In fact, people usually function better off of opioids. You can check out our tips (links to resource page) on how to manage your pain in LIMIT. Also, it may help you to listen to some other veterans’ experiences.

          <Paragraph>Craving means you are preoccupied with the thought of getting more medication or being able to take medication right away. This is another problem Veterans can encounter when they reduce the dose of their medication too quickly. To avoid craving, just like to avoid withdrawal, the key is to reduce opioid medication gradually. The other important strategy to reduce or avoid craving is to have other activities and stay busy so that the thoughts of taking the next dose of medication are less strong.</Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>A lot of Veterans feel like they’ve tried most everything already. A couple things to consider: You’re likely at a different place now – a different mindset, a different set of life circumstances – than you were when you tried some of those other things. Another try is probably worth a go! Also, there are new approaches coming on the scene all the time. Click here (links to page describing non-pharmacologic options at the VA – by site) to see some of the options available at the VA.
