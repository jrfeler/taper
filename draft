          <Paragraph>Over time, the body adapts to opioid medications so that if you reduce them rapidly, withdrawal symptoms are likely. However, if you reduce the dose of opioids gradually, the body can make new adaptations to the lower doses and withdrawal symptoms generally are extremely mild or absent.

          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>Veteran #1: “If you’ve experienced withdrawal symptoms before, it’s understandable that you’d be worried about going through that again. But the good news is, if you go slow enough with the taper – like you are doing – withdrawal symptoms are extremely unlikely. I’ll be honest, I didn’t even notice the medication was being lowered. Interestingly, my pain wasn’t even worse. At the end of the whole process, I just overall felt better – less sluggish than when I was on the medications.”
